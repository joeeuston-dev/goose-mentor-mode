## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Strategy

### Core Development Approach

#### 1. Extension Architecture
```python
# Goose Extension Structure
mentor_mode/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py              # Extension entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mentor_engine.py         # Core mentoring logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interaction_controller.py # Conversation flow management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge_validator.py   # Understanding verification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning_tracker.py     # Progress monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content_generator.py    # Educational content creation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mentor_tools.py     # Mentor-specific commands
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_injector.py # Strategic question insertion
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ progress_reporter.py # Learning analytics
```

#### 2. Integration Points
- **Tool Interception**: Wrap existing Goose tools to inject educational moments
- **Memory Integration**: Leverage Goose memory system for learning tracking
- **Conversation Management**: Extend Goose conversation flow with pause points
- **Context Awareness**: Integrate with project context and timeline awareness

#### 3. Data Structures
```python
# Learning Progress Tracking
LearningProfile = {
    "developer_id": str,
    "knowledge_areas": Dict[str, KnowledgeLevel],
    "learning_preferences": LearningPreferences,
    "session_history": List[LearningSession],
    "mastery_indicators": Dict[str, MasteryMetrics]
}

# Context Information
SessionContext = {
    "timeline_pressure": PressureLevel,
    "learning_mode": LearningMode,
    "project_complexity": ComplexityLevel,
    "current_task": TaskContext,
    "available_mentors": List[MentorAvailability]

# Interaction Patterns

## Conversation Flow Design

This document defines the specific interaction patterns that make Mentor Mode educational while maintaining natural conversation flow.

## üîÑ Core Interaction Cycle

### Standard Mentor Mode Flow
```
Developer Request ‚Üí Intent Analysis ‚Üí Context Assessment ‚Üí 
Assistance Level Selection ‚Üí Educational Response ‚Üí 
Knowledge Validation ‚Üí Progress Tracking ‚Üí Continue/Loop
```

### Example Flow Breakdown
```
1. Developer: "I need to add authentication to this API"
2. Intent Analysis: Complex task, authentication knowledge needed
3. Context Assessment: Learning session, no time pressure
4. Assistance Level: Guided (high educational value)
5. Educational Response: Strategic questions about auth methods
6. Knowledge Validation: Assess understanding of security principles
7. Progress Tracking: Update knowledge of authentication patterns
8. Continue: Proceed with guided implementation
```

## üìö Assistance Level Patterns

### Level 1: Guided Discovery
**Purpose**: Maximum learning through self-discovery

**Pattern Structure**:
1. **Question First**: Ask about approach before showing solution
2. **Hint Progression**: Provide increasingly specific hints
3. **Validation Checkpoints**: Confirm understanding at each step
4. **Principle Connection**: Link to broader programming concepts

**Example Interaction**:
```
Developer: "I need to hash passwords"
Mentor: "Great security thinking! Before I show you how, what do you know about password hashing? What makes one hashing method better than another?"

Developer: "I think bcrypt is good because it's slow?"
Mentor: "Exactly! You understand the key principle. The 'slowness' is actually computational cost that makes brute force attacks impractical. Can you think of why we'd want to make hashing deliberately expensive?"

Developer: "To make it harder for attackers to try lots of passwords?"
Mentor: "Perfect! Now let's implement bcrypt. I'll show you the code, but watch for how we control that computational cost..."
```

### Level 2: Explained Implementation
**Purpose**: Show solutions with comprehensive educational context

**Pattern Structure**:
1. **Concept Overview**: Explain the approach before implementation
2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**: Detailed explanation of each decision
3. **Alternative Discussion**: Why this approach over others
4. **Best Practices Integration**: Point out industry standards

**Example Interaction**:
```
Developer: "I need to add authentication"
Mentor: "I'll implement JWT authentication for you. Let me explain my approach:

1. First, I'm choosing JWT over sessions because your API is stateless
2. I'll use a secure signing algorithm (RS256) rather than HS256
3. We'll implement both access and refresh tokens for security
4. I'll add proper error handling for expired/invalid tokens

Here's the implementation with detailed comments explaining each security decision..."
```

### Level 3: Assisted Development
**Purpose**: Quick solutions with key learning highlights

**Pattern Structure**:
1. **Rapid Implementation**: Solve problem efficiently
2. **Key Insight Highlights**: Point out 2-3 important lessons
3. **Future Learning Hooks**: Suggest areas for deeper study
4. **Quality Callouts**: Highlight best practices being followed

**Example Interaction**:
```
Developer: "I need authentication quickly"
Mentor: "I'll implement this rapidly. Key things to notice:
1. I'm using environment variables for secrets (never hardcode!)
2. Adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
3. Implementing proper CORS headers for browser security

[Provides complete implementation]

When you have time, I'd recommend studying how JWT signing works and why we use refresh tokens. Want me to bookmark these topics for later exploration?"
```

### Level 4: Automated (Emergency Mode)
**Purpose**: Full automation with minimal learning interruption

**Pattern Structure**:
1. **Immediate Solution**: Provide complete implementation
2. **Brief Rationale**: One-sentence explanation of approach
3. **Learning Deferral**: Offer to explain later when time permits
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure solution follows best practices

**Example Interaction**:
```
Developer: "Need auth ASAP for demo in 1 hour"
Mentor: "Implementing complete JWT authentication with security best practices. I'll add comprehensive comments for later review. We can do a detailed walkthrough after your demo if you'd like to understand the security considerations."
```

## üéØ Strategic Question Types

### Discovery Questions
**Purpose**: Guide developers to correct solutions

**Examples**:
- "What security considerations should we think about here?"
- "How might this approach scale as the user base grows?"
- "What could go wrong if we implemented it this way?"
- "What patterns have you seen for handling this type of problem?"

### Comprehension Validation
**Purpose**: Verify understanding before proceeding

**Examples**:
- "Can you explain why we chose this approach over X?"
- "What would happen if we changed this parameter?"
- "How does this relate to the SOLID principles we discussed?"
- "What part of this implementation handles the edge case we mentioned?"

### Principle Connection
**Purpose**: Link specific implementations to broader concepts

**Examples**:
- "How does this demonstrate the principle of least privilege?"
- "What design pattern are we implementing here?"
- "How does this follow the single responsibility principle?"
- "What architectural benefit does this approach provide?"

### Scenario Testing
**Purpose**: Test understanding through hypothetical situations

**Examples**:
- "How would you modify this for a microservices architecture?"
- "What if we needed to support 1 million concurrent users?"
- "How would you debug this if users reported intermittent failures?"
- "What changes would be needed for GDPR compliance?"

## üß© Progressive Disclosure Patterns

### Code Revelation Strategy
**Sequential revelation of solution components**

```python
# Step 1: Show structure only
def authenticate_user(credentials):
    # TODO: Validate credentials
    # TODO: Check user permissions
    # TODO: Generate JWT token
    # TODO: Handle errors
    pass

# Step 2: Fill in one section after discussion
def authenticate_user(credentials):
    # Validate credentials format
    if not credentials.get('username') or not credentials.get('password'):
        raise ValueError("Username and password required")
    
    # TODO: Check user permissions
    # TODO: Generate JWT token
    # TODO: Handle errors

# Step 3: Continue after understanding validation
# ... and so on
```

### Concept Building Blocks
**Layer concepts from simple to complex**

```
1. First: Basic password checking
2. Then: Hash verification
3. Next: Salt and pepper concepts
4. Advanced: Key stretching and timing attacks
5. Expert: Hardware security modules and key rotation
```

## üîç Context-Aware Adaptations

### Timeline Pressure Detection
**Automatic assistance level adjustment based on context**

```python
def detect_pressure_indicators():
    indicators = {
        "high_pressure": [
            "urgent", "ASAP", "demo", "deadline", 
            "meeting in", "need this now", "quickly"
        ],
        "learning_mode": [
            "understand", "learn", "explain", "why",
            "how does this work", "teach me"
        ],
        "exploration": [
            "best practice", "right way", "alternatives",
            "compare", "pros and cons"
        ]
    }
    # Analyze user input for pressure indicators
    # Adjust assistance level accordingly
```

### Skill Level Assessment
**Dynamic adjustment based on demonstrated competence**

```
Beginner Indicators:
- Basic syntax questions
- Confusion about common patterns
- Need for fundamental concept explanations

Intermediate Indicators:
- Understanding of patterns but uncertainty about application
- Questions about best practices and trade-offs
- Ability to implement but seeks optimization

Advanced Indicators:
- Focus on architecture and scalability
- Questions about edge cases and performance
- Interest in alternative approaches and innovations
```

## üí° Knowledge Validation Techniques

### Explanation Requests
**Ask developers to articulate their understanding**

```
"Before we move on, can you explain in your own words why we used dependency injection here?"

"Walk me through what happens when a user makes an authenticated request to this endpoint."

"What security vulnerabilities does this implementation protect against?"
```

### Code Modification Challenges
**Test understanding through hypothetical changes**

```
"If I asked you to add rate limiting to this endpoint, where would you make changes and why?"

"How would you modify this to support both API keys and JWT tokens?"

"What would you change to make this work in a distributed system?"
```

### Debugging Scenarios
**Present problems to solve using current knowledge**

```
"A user reports they can't log in, but their credentials are correct. What would you check first?"

"The API is returning 500 errors intermittently. How would you investigate using this code?"

"Performance is slow during peak hours. What might be the bottleneck in this authentication flow?"
```

## üîÑ Conversation Recovery Patterns

### When Learning Stalls
**Strategies for overcoming understanding blocks**

1. **Simplify**: Break down complex concepts into smaller pieces
2. **Analogize**: Use real-world analogies to explain technical concepts
3. **Visualize**: Provide diagrams or step-by-step breakdowns
4. **Redirect**: Try a different approach or teaching method
5. **Defer**: Acknowledge complexity and suggest revisiting later

### When Time Pressure Increases
**Graceful degradation from learning to productivity**

```
"I notice we're running short on time. Let me implement this quickly, and I'll add comprehensive comments so we can review the approach later. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up learning session?"
```

### When Understanding Is Validated
**Positive reinforcement and progression**

```
"Excellent! You clearly understand the security implications. This shows you're ready for more advanced authentication patterns. Shall we explore OAuth2 flows in our next session?"
```

# Mentor Mode: Immediate Action Plan

## ðŸ“… Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. **Enhanced MCP Extension Development**
**Timeline**: Start immediately
**Goal**: Create working mentor extension that proves educational intervention concept

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up MCP mentor extension project structure (`mcp-mentor/`)
- [ ] Implement core educational tools:
  - `mentor_analyze_question()` - Learning opportunity detection
  - `mentor_guided_response()` - Socratic questioning generation
  - `mentor_learning_check()` - Knowledge validation
- [ ] Create sophisticated `instructions()` prompt injection for educational context
- [ ] Test integration with Goose desktop application

**Expected Outcome**: Working extension that can influence Goose to engage in educational conversations

### 2. **Goose Team Outreach**
**Timeline**: This week
**Goal**: Establish relationship and explore grant opportunity

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research Goose team contact information and grant program details
- [ ] Prepare initial outreach message highlighting:
  - Educational mentor concept and market opportunity
  - Technical innovation potential
  - Our proven educational logic and architecture analysis
- [ ] Share our findings about core integration possibilities
- [ ] Inquire about grant program timeline and requirements

**Expected Outcome**: Contact established, interest level assessed, grant process clarified

### 3. **Core Architecture Deep Dive**
**Timeline**: Ongoing this week
**Goal**: Prepare for potential core integration development

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Rust development environment
- [ ] Build Goose from source to validate development setup
- [ ] Study agent message processing pipeline in detail (`agent.rs`)
- [ ] Identify specific integration points for educational preprocessing
- [ ] Create detailed technical specification for core integration

**Expected Outcome**: Ready to begin core integration if grant opportunity materializes

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria (End of Week)

### MCP Extension Path
- [ ] **Functional Extension**: Working mentor extension integrated with Goose
- [ ] **Educational Demonstration**: Example conversation showing Socratic questioning
- [ ] **Technical Validation**: Proof that system prompt injection influences conversation flow

### Grant Opportunity Path
- [ ] **Team Contact**: Communication established with Goose development team
- [ ] **Grant Understanding**: Clear timeline and requirements for grant application
- [ ] **Technical Readiness**: Core integration specification prepared

### Documentation & Planning
- [ ] **Architecture Analysis**: Complete technical documentation (âœ… Done)
- [ ] **Implementation Spec**: Detailed specification for both MCP and core approaches
- [ ] **Grant Proposal Outline**: Initial draft of grant application structure

## ðŸš€ Key Questions to Resolve

1. **Grant Program**: What are the specific requirements, timeline, and evaluation criteria?
2. **Technical Integration**: Which core integration points provide best educational intervention opportunities?
3. **User Experience**: How do we balance educational value with user productivity needs?
4. **Market Validation**: What evidence do we need to demonstrate educational AI demand?

## ðŸ’¡ Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Prove the Concept (MCP Extension)
- Demonstrate that educational intervention can work within current Goose architecture
- Validate that sophisticated prompt injection can influence conversation flow
- Create compelling demonstration of educational value

### Priority 2: Position for Grant Success
- Build relationship with Goose team around shared educational vision
- Demonstrate technical competence through working prototype
- Align proposal with Block's strategic interests in developer education

### Priority 3: Maintain Multiple Pathways
- Ensure MCP extension provides standalone value regardless of grant outcome
- Keep core integration option viable through continued architecture study
- Design educational logic to be portable between implementation approaches

## ðŸ“‹ Resource Requirements

### Immediate (This Week)
- **Development Time**: ~20 hours for MCP extension development
- **Research Time**: ~10 hours for Goose team outreach and grant research
- **Learning Time**: ~10 hours for Rust environment setup and architecture study

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
- **MCP Extension**: Python/MCP development environment and testing
- **Rust Learning**: Resources for learning Rust for potential core integration
- **Grant Application**: Time for comprehensive proposal development if opportunity confirmed

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
- **Core Integration**: Rust development environment and extended development time
- **User Testing**: Access to developers for educational effectiveness validation
- **Community Engagement**: Resources for documentation and community building

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Points

### Week 1 Decision: Grant Viability
**If grant opportunity is strong**: Focus resources on grant preparation alongside MCP development
**If grant opportunity is limited**: Prioritize MCP extension with independent distribution strategy

### Week 2 Decision: Implementation Focus
**If MCP extension proves highly effective**: Continue enhancing extension-based approach
**If MCP limitations are significant**: Accelerate core integration development

### Week 4 Decision: Project Direction
**If core integration is feasible**: Submit grant application and continue dual-track development
**If core integration is blocked**: Focus on MCP extension ecosystem and independent distribution

---

**Status**: Ready to execute. Multiple viable paths identified. High confidence in successful implementation through at least one pathway, with potential for breakthrough educational AI innovation through grant-funded core integration.

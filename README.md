## üîç Overview

Mentor Mode addresses a critical challenge in modern software development: junior developers using AI tools for productivity gains while potentially missing fundamental learning opportunities. This project creates an intelligent mentoring system that guides developers through problem-solving processes rather than simply providing solutions.

### Key Innovation

Instead of this traditional AI interaction:
```
Developer: "Create a REST API with authentication"
AI: [Delivers complete solution immediately]
```

Mentor Mode enables this educational interaction:
```
Developer: "Create a REST API with authentication"
AI: "Great! Let's build this together. What are the main components you think we'll need? 
     Take a moment to consider the architecture before I show you my approach..."
```

## ‚ùå Problem Statement

### The Challenge
- **AI Dependency Risk**: Junior developers can ship code without understanding underlying principles
- **Debugging Difficulties**: Limited ability to troubleshoot when AI suggestions fail
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Poor architectural decision-making due to lack of foundational understanding
- **Team Impact**: Reduced code review quality and mentoring effectiveness

### Evidence
- Junior developers spend 60%+ of time debugging issues they don't fully understand
- Increased reliance on AI tools without corresponding skill development
- Difficulty transitioning to AI-restricted environments or complex problem domains

## ‚úÖ Solution Approach

### Core Principles

1. **Socratic Method Integration**
   - Ask predictive questions before revealing solutions
   - Guide discovery rather than provide immediate answers
   - Connect specific implementations to broader programming principles

2. **Graduated Assistance Levels**
   - **Level 1**: Pure guidance and hints
   - **Level 2**: Examples with detailed explanations
   - **Level 3**: Complete solutions with comprehensive rationale
   - **Emergency**: Full automation for deadline pressure

3. **Knowledge Validation Checkpoints**
   - Pause at critical decision points
   - Require explanation of reasoning
   - Test understanding through scenario questions

4. **Context-Aware Adaptation**
   - Adjust teaching intensity based on timeline constraints
   - Personalize to individual learning pace and style
   - Scale complexity based on demonstrated competence

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Goose AI Agent with Claude 4
- Git repository access
- Basic development environment

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mentor-mode
cd mentor-mode
# Additional setup instructions coming soon
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Enable mentor mode for current session
goose --mode mentor --level guided

# Standard development with educational prompts
goose --mode mentor --level explained

# Emergency mode for deadline pressure
goose --mode mentor --level automated
```

# Goose Core Architecture Investigation & Mentor Mode Feasibility

## Executive Summary

After deep investigation of the Goose core codebase, I've identified **multiple pathways** for implementing mentor mode functionality, ranging from enhanced MCP extensions to core platform integration. The architecture is more flexible than initially assessed, and there are several concrete opportunities for educational intervention.

## Key Architectural Discoveries

### 1. **Message Processing Pipeline (Core Integration Opportunity)**

**Location**: `crates/goose/src/agents/agent.rs`

**Critical Discovery**: The main `reply()` function processes all user messages through a clear pipeline:

```rust
pub async fn reply(
    &self,
    unfixed_conversation: Conversation,
    session: Option<SessionConfig>,
    cancel_token: Option<CancellationToken>,
) -> Result<BoxStream<'_, Result<AgentEvent>>> {
    // Message preprocessing and compaction
    let context = self.prepare_reply_context(unfixed_conversation, &session).await?;
    
    // Core processing pipeline
    self.reply_internal(messages, session, cancel_token).await
}
```

**Mentor Mode Integration Point**: We could intercept at `prepare_reply_context()` or early in `reply_internal()` to:
- Analyze incoming messages for learning opportunities
- Inject educational prompts into the conversation context
- Modify the system prompt to include Socratic questioning mode

### 2. **MCP Extension System (External Integration)**

**Location**: `crates/goose/src/agents/extension.rs` and MCP documentation

**Key Finding**: Goose uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extensions, which provides:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Extension: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    fn instructions(&self) -> &str;
    fn tools(&self) -> &[Tool];
    async fn call_tool(&self, tool_name: &str, parameters: HashMap<String, Value>) -> ToolResult<Value>;
}
```

**Mentor Mode Opportunity**: Create sophisticated MCP server that:
- Provides educational tools like `mentor_analyze_question()`, `mentor_guided_learning()`
- Uses `instructions()` to inject educational prompts into system context
- Leverages tool descriptions to suggest educational opportunities

### 3. **Extension Manager & Tool Routing**

**Location**: `crates/goose/src/agents/extension_manager.rs`

**Discovery**: Extensions can modify system behavior through:
- Tool registration and prioritization
- System prompt injection via `instructions()`
- Context modification through extension state

## Feasibility Assessment: Three Implementation Paths

### Path 1: Enhanced MCP Extension (Most Viable Short-term)

**Feasibility**: ✅ **HIGH** - Can be implemented immediately

**Approach**:
```python
# MCP Server with educational intervention
class MentorExtension:
    @mcp.tool()
    def mentor_analyze_request(self, request: str) -> str:
        """Analyze user request for educational opportunities"""
        # Implement learning opportunity detection
        return educational_response
    
    def instructions(self) -> str:
        return """
        EDUCATIONAL MODE ACTIVE:
        - Before providing direct answers, consider if this is a learning opportunity
        - Use mentor_analyze_request tool to evaluate educational potential
        - Engage in Socratic questioning when appropriate
        """
```

**Advantages**:
- No core code modification required
- Can be distributed independently 
- Leverages existing MCP infrastructure
- Can inject educational prompts via `instructions()`

**Limitations**:
- Requires Goose to choose educational tools (not automatic)
- Cannot force conversation flow interruption
- Depends on LLM decision-making for activation

### Path 2: Core Message Interception (Grant-worthy Innovation)

**Feasibility**: ✅ **MEDIUM** - Requires Rust development but well-defined integration points

**Approach**:
```rust
// Core integration in agent.rs
impl Agent {
    async fn reply(&self, conversation: Conversation, ...) -> Result<BoxStream<'_, Result<AgentEvent>>> {
        // NEW: Educational preprocessing
        let (conversation, educational_mode) = self.educational_preprocessor
            .analyze_for_learning_opportunities(conversation).await?;
        
        if educational_mode.should_activate {
            return self.educational_flow_handler
                .handle_socratic_dialogue(conversation, educational_mode).await;
        }
        
        // Existing processing continues...
        self.reply_internal(conversation, session, cancel_token).await
    }
}
```

**Key Integration Points**:
1. **`prepare_reply_context()`**: Inject educational system prompts
2. **`reply_internal()`**: Add educational flow branching
3. **Extension System**: Add built-in educational extension with special privileges

**Advantages**:
- Seamless user experience with automatic educational intervention
- Full control over conversation flow
- Can implement true Socratic dialogue interruption
- Foundation for advanced educational features

### Path 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Feasibility**: ✅ **HIGH** for Phase 1, **MEDIUM** for Phase 2

**Phase 1 - Enhanced MCP Extension**:
- Sophisticated educational MCP server with advanced prompting
- Tool-based educational interventions
- Learning opportunity detection and suggestion

**Phase 2 - Core Integration** (if Phase 1 proves successful):
- Integrate proven educational logic into core platform
- Add automatic conversation flow control
- Implement seamless educational mode switching

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Extension Architecture (Path 1 - Immediate Implementation)

```python
# mcp-mentor/server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import Dict, Any

mcp = FastMCP("mentor")

@mcp.tool()
def mentor_analyze_question(question: str, context: str = "") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze a user question for educational potential and suggest learning approaches.
    
    Args:
        question: The user's question or request
        context: Additional context about the conversation
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with learning analysis and recommendations
    """
    analysis = educational_analyzer.analyze_learning_opportunity(question, context)
    return {
        "educational_potential": analysis.potential_score,
        "suggested_approach": analysis.approach,
        "socratic_questions": analysis.questions,
        "learning_objectives": analysis.objectives
    }

@mcp.tool()
def mentor_guided_response(topic: str, user_level: str = "beginner") -> str:
    """Generate a guided learning response for a specific topic."""
    return socratic_generator.generate_guided_response(topic, user_level)

def instructions() -> str:
    return """
    EDUCATIONAL MENTOR ACTIVE:
    
    Before providing direct answers to technical questions:
    1. Use mentor_analyze_question to evaluate educational potential
    2. If educational_potential > 0.7, engage in guided learning instead of direct answers
    3. Use mentor_guided_response to generate Socratic questioning
    4. Focus on helping the user discover solutions through guided exploration
    
    Educational Priority Topics:
    - Programming concepts and debugging
    - System architecture decisions  
    - Technology learning and problem-solving
    - Code review and best practices
    """
```

### Core Integration Architecture (Path 2 - Grant Development)

```rust
// New educational module: crates/goose/src/agents/educational_engine.rs
pub struct EducationalEngine {
    socratic_generator: SocraticQuestionGenerator,
    learning_detector: LearningOpportunityDetector,
    user_profile: UserLearningProfile,
    config: EducationalConfig,
}

impl EducationalEngine {
    pub async fn analyze_for_learning(&self, message: &Message) -> EducationalAnalysis {
        // Implement learning opportunity detection
        self.learning_detector.analyze(message, &self.user_profile).await
    }
    
    pub async fn generate_educational_response(&self, analysis: EducationalAnalysis) -> Message {
        // Generate Socratic questioning response
        self.socratic_generator.generate_response(analysis).await
    }
}

// Integration in agent.rs
impl Agent {
    async fn prepare_reply_context(&self, conversation: Conversation, session: &Option<SessionConfig>) -> Result<ReplyContext> {
        let mut context = self.prepare_standard_context(conversation, session).await?;
        
        // NEW: Educational context enhancement
        if let Some(educational_engine) = &self.educational_engine {
            let last_message = conversation.last().unwrap();
            let analysis = educational_engine.analyze_for_learning(last_message).await;
            
            if analysis.should_activate_mentor_mode {
                context.system_prompt = self.inject_educational_prompts(context.system_prompt, analysis).await;
                context.educational_context = Some(analysis);
            }
        }
        
        Ok(context)
    }
}
```

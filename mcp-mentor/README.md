> 🎯 **Transform AI assistance from automation to guided learning experiences**

## 🚀 Overview

The Mentor Mode MCP Extension integrates educational mentorship capabilities into AI development workflows through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This extension provides sophisticated tools that enable AI agents like Goose to deliver educational guidance rather than just solutions.

### Key Innovation

Instead of traditional AI interactions that immediately provide solutions, Mentor Mode creates learning-focused experiences:

```
Traditional AI:
Developer: "How do I implement JWT authentication?"
AI: [Delivers complete solution immediately]

Mentor Mode:
Developer: "How do I implement JWT authentication?"
AI: "Great learning opportunity! Let's explore this step-by-step. What do you think 
     are the main security considerations we need to address first?"
```

## 🎯 Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Learning Opportunity Detection**
- Analyzes requests for educational value

    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Basic Usage Examples

```python
# Educational analysis of a request
result = await mentor_analyze_request(
    user_request="How do I implement JWT authentication in my Node.js API?",
    context={
        "timeline_pressure": "low",
        "learning_phase": "skill_building",
        "skills": {"javascript": 3, "security": 1}
    }
)

# Learning validation
feedback = await mentor_learning_check(
    concept="JWT Authentication",
    user_explanation="JWT is a token that contains user information...",
    expected_understanding=["stateless authentication", "security considerations", "token structure"]
)

# Progress tracking
progress = await mentor_track_progress(
    activity="JWT Implementation",
    success_indicators={"completed": True, "understood_security": True}
)
```

## 📚 Tool Documentation

### `mentor_analyze_request`

Analyzes developer requests for learning opportunities and generates appropriate educational responses.

**Parameters:**
- `user_request` (string): The developer's request or question
- `context` (object, optional): Session context including timeline pressure, skills, etc.
- `assistance_level` (string, optional): Override assistance level

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "type": "mentor_response",
  "assistance_level": "explained",
  "educational_content": "📚 Let's implement JWT authentication step-by-step...",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand security principles and best practices",
    "Learn authentication patterns"
  ],
  "follow_up_questions": [
    "Can you explain why this approach works?",
    "What security considerations should we address?"
  ],
  "validation_checkpoints": [
    "Can explain the solution approach",
    "Understands key security concepts"
  ]
}
```

### `mentor_learning_check`

Validates understanding of concepts through Socratic questioning and provides educational feedback.

**Parameters:**
- `concept` (string): The concept being validated
- `user_explanation` (string): User's explanation of the concept
- `expected_understanding` (array): Key points that should be understood

### `mentor_track_progress`

Tracks learning progress and provides personalized recommendations for continued development.

**Parameters:**
- `activity` (string): The learning activity completed
- `success_indicators` (object): Indicators of success or areas needing improvement

### `mentor_suggest_assistance_level`

Analyzes context and suggests the most appropriate assistance level for maximum learning benefit.

**Parameters:**
- `user_request` (string): The developer's request
- `context` (object): Session context and developer information

## 🎯 Integration Examples

### Goose Integration

When integrated with Goose, Mentor Mode can automatically detect learning opportunities:

```typescript
// Goose detects a learning-oriented request
const mentorResponse = await tools.mentor_analyze_request({
  user_request: "Help me understand async/await in JavaScript",
  context: {
    timeline_pressure: "low",
    learning_phase: "skill_building"
  }
});

if (mentorResponse.type === "mentor_response") {
  // Provide educational guidance instead of direct solution
  return mentorResponse.educational_content;
}
```

### Custom Learning Workflows

```python
# Progressive learning workflow
async def guided_learning_session(topic: str, user_context: dict):
    # 1. Analyze learning opportunity
    analysis = await mentor_analyze_request(
        user_request=f"I want to learn about {topic}",
        context=user_context
    )
    
    # 2. Deliver educational content
    print(analysis["educational_content"])
    
    # 3. Validate understanding
    user_explanation = input("Please explain your understanding: ")
    feedback = await mentor_learning_check(
        concept=topic,
        user_explanation=user_explanation,
        expected_understanding=analysis["learning_objectives"]
    )
    
    # 4. Track progress
    await mentor_track_progress(
        activity=f"{topic} Learning Session",
        success_indicators={"understanding_score": feedback["understanding_score"]}
    )
    
    return feedback
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Assistance Level Customization

```python
# Override default assistance level selection
mentor_config = {
    "default_assistance_level": "guided",  # guided, explained, assisted, automated
    "learning_phase": "skill_building",    # onboarding, skill_building, production
    "enable_validation_checkpoints": True,
    "max_guidance_depth": 3
}
```

### Learning Opportunity Detection

The system automatically detects:
- **Security Concepts**: JWT, authentication, authorization, encryption, etc.
- **Architecture Patterns**: API, REST, microservices, databases, etc.
- **Best Practices**: Error handling, validation, testing, logging, etc.

## 📈 Learning Analytics

Track educational effectiveness:

```python
analytics = await mentor_track_progress(
    activity="API Development Session",
    success_indicators={
        "concepts_learned": ["JWT", "REST APIs", "error handling"],
        "time_spent": 45,
        "understanding_demonstrated": True
    }
)

print(f"Learning Analytics: {analytics['analytics']}")
```

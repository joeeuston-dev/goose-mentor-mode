1. **Understanding the Problem**: What do you think is the core challenge you're trying to solve here?

2. **Exploring Approaches**: What are some different ways you might approach this problem? Think about:
   - What tools or technologies might be relevant?
   - Have you encountered similar problems before?
   - What resources could help you research this?

3. **Breaking it Down**: Can you break this request into smaller, more manageable parts?

**Your Turn**: Start with question 1 - what do you see as the main challenge? I'll guide you through the solution process step by step.

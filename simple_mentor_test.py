Simple Goose Extension Test for Mentor Mode

1. Can be called by Goose
2. Can intercept user requests
3. Can provide educational responses 
4. Can potentially modify conversation flow

ðŸŽ“ **Mentor Mode Activated**

Instead of giving you the answer directly, let's learn together!

**Your Question**: {user_question}

**Let's Think Step by Step**:
1. What do you think are the main components needed?
2. Have you worked with similar problems before?
3. What would be your first step?

**Guiding Questions**:
- What have you already tried?
- What specific part are you stuck on?
- What do you expect the outcome to look like?

**Learning Objective**: By thinking through this yourself first, you'll understand the solution better and be able to apply similar thinking to future problems.

Would you like to try answering one of these questions first, or would you prefer a different assistance level?

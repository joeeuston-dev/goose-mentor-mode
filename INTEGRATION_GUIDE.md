## üìö **Live Educational Conversation Example**

**User Request:** "How do I implement JWT authentication in my Node.js API?"

**Mentor System Analysis:**
```json
{
  "type": "mentor_response",
  "assistance_level": "explained",
  "educational_content": "üìö **Educational Response**\n\nI'll solve this for you while explaining the reasoning and teaching key concepts along the way...",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand solution reasoning",
    "Learn applicable patterns", 
    "Build conceptual knowledge",
    "Understand security principles and best practices"
  ],
  "follow_up_questions": [
    "Can you explain why this approach works?",
    "What other scenarios might use similar patterns?",
    "What questions do you have about the implementation?"
  ]
}
```

**Learning Validation Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "learning_feedback",
  "understanding_score": 1.0,
  "feedback_type": "excellent_understanding", 
  "message": "Excellent understanding of JWT Authentication! You've demonstrated strong grasp of the key concepts.",
  "next_steps": [
    "Try applying JWT Authentication to a different scenario",
    "Explore advanced aspects or edge cases"
  ]
}
```
